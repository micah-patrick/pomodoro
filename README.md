# Pomomdoro Timer

Thinkful student project built using React and Bootstrap. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method. A timer divides time into focus and break sessions. A user focuses (for 25 minutes by default) and takes a break (for 5 minutes by default). Focus sessions can be adjust in 5 minute increments between 5 and 60 minutes. Break sessions can be 1 to 15 minutes in 1 minute increments.
